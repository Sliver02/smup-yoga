    "description1": "<strong>Hi, I'm Sarah and I live in the Dolomites!</strong> I am a dynamic and curious person and this has led me to explore many things, in the end I decided that Yoga was my path. I firmly believe that in this society people need to reconnect with themselves, with nature and with their breath.",
    "description2": "<strong>I started practicing Yoga in 2016 and I immediately fell in love with it.</strong> It was a period of overthinking and during the hours of Yoga I managed not to think for a whole hour, almost like magic.",
    "description3": "After raving to anyone about its benefits (I still do), I decided to undertake teacher training in Milan. I trained with the Samadhi school, which founded Anukalana Yoga."

      "description_long": "<strong>Anukalana means integration</strong>, in fact it is a style that combines many notions: obviously Asana, Pranayama, Meditations, but also myofascia, meridians and energy centers. It bases movements on fluidity, coordination with the breath and gentleness. What fascinated me most about this style is that it is suitable for everyone. It is not competitive, but truly aimed at the well-being of each individual.",
      "description": "Integrated practice combining asana, pranayama, meditation and fascia/movement work. Gentle, breath‑led sequences that focus on fluidity and overall wellbeing."

      "title": "Yin Yoga",
      "description_long": "Yin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga in which poses are held for longer periods of time than in more active styles. We will get comfortable with cushions called 'bolsters', yoga blocks, and whatever else is needed to make the asanas comfortable and perfectly suited to everyone's needs and flexibility. The purpose of yin yoga is to stimulate the connective tissue, applying optimal tension for a certain time and maintaining deep breathing. By doing this, the connective tissue lengthens, strengthens, and slowly opens up, creating more space between the joints, improving their movement and making them more solid, stable, and strong, and increasing muscle flexibility.",
      "description": "Slow passive postures aided by props. Usefull to stimulate connective tissue, increse joint mobility, encourage deep breathing and restorative release for body and mind."

      "description": "Playful, creative sessions using stories, songs and games to teach asanas, breath awareness and mindful listening while building confidence and calm."
